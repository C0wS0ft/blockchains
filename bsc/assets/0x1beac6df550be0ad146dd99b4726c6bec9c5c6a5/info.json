 "Description": "Piggy is a decentralized borrowing protocol that offers interest-free, efficiently collateralized loans backed by $BNB. Unlike competing DeFi lenders, Piggy runs liquidations by making use of a Stability Pool mechanism instead of auctions.$PIGGY is the secondary token issued by the Piggy protocol. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system and incentivizes early adopters. Holders can stake their tokens to earn the fees generated by loan issuance and $PUSD redemptions.Telegram | MediumWhitepaper",
