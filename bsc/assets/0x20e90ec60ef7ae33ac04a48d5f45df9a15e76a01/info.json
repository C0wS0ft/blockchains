 "Description": "Pokmonster is a Binance Smart Chain-based real-time game in which players can earn tokens through turn-based battles.\"A very long time ago, there was a multiverse event happening on the planets. The gate between the worlds appeared as a result of this event. Pokmonsters from the Pokmonsters world are rapidly being sucked into the vortex, moving into the earth\u0026#39;s space. They\u0026#39;ve adapted to life here after a period of chaos and emptiness, embarking on exciting and challenging new adventures. On this first earth, they were called Pokmonsters.\"TelegramÂ | Medium",
