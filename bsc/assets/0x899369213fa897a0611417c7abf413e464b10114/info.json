 "Description": "CUEX is a taxed token (10% on all TX) in the CUE ecosystem that features an automated market maker, providing liquidity to CUEX \u0026amp; CUE tokens via tax. It\u0026#39;s designed to allow CUE Protocol to enter the DeFi space and grow the ecosystem even bigger than originally planned. In addition, it helps the CUE token build its Pancakeswap v2 liquidity due to v1 liquidity being locked until March 2022. With the staking features available, the two tokens are working in tandem to ensure benefits for all holders.Telegram",
