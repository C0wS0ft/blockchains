 "Description": "MemeWars is a DeFi game that allows players to strategically stake, defend and attack enemy staking pools.Full game launching will be on Dec 6, 2021. For additional information regarding the game, please refer to the official game paper.MemeWars is built on Binance Smart Chain, and uses only a single currency, the $MWAR token. Unlike most play-to-earn models, MemeWars requires players to stake and burn their tokens in order to participate in the game, creating a new type of GameFi concept called “Burn-to-Earn”. Staking MWAR tokens into a team and sub-pool enables users to gain ownership and voting rights in that pool. Users can stake in one of three teams, and one of three sub-pools in each team (attack, defense \u0026amp; production).The MemeWars web app will be available on both desktop and mobile devices, optimized for all screen sizes and compatible with the leading crypto wallets like TrustWallet, Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and more.Telegram",
