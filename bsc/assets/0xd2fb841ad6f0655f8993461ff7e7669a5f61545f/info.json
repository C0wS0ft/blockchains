 "Description": "IMPULSE is a high frequency algorithm for market making on the ETH/USD pair via the Bybit exchange platform guaranteed by an erc20 token and decentralized finance on Uniswap. It is designed to evolve organically without private and/or public selling and intelligent capital management. Every day, the Bybit account buys the IMPULSE tokens directly from the Uniswap pool. The price of the token is thus increasing according to the performance of the algorithm. This means that your IMPULSE investment can increase in value even if no one buys at a higher price than you.",
