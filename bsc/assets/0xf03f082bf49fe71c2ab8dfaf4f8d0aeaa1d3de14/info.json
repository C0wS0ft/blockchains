 "Description": "Ponyo Impact is an anime-inspired “auto-impact” investing token. Inspired by the sea-based 2008 Japanese film about a rescued goldfish, our founders are on a mission to prove that Web 3.0 can make the world a better place. In testing our thesis, we devised a sustainable investing model. 3% of all Ponyo transactions are automatically donated to the Coral Restoration Foundation, one of the world’s most effective non-profit organizations supporting coral reefs’ natural recovery processes. We are setting the paradigm that investing in crypto can be a fundamentally sustainable business.Telegram | Discord (Ponyo Impact NFT Launchpad) | Twitter | TikTok | Youtube | Reddit Audit | Litepaper",
