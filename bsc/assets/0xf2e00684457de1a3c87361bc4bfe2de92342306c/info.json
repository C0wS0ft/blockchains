 "Description": "Shield Network is a token on the BSC platform aspiring to make the crypto market safer for everyone to invest in. The token is deflationary with a 2% tax on every transaction. 1% is burned, the other 1% is redistributed amongst holders. The token will forever increase in rarity. Its goals are beyond making a BSC token, the main goal is to create a token audit platform where every token is thoroughly audited by the Shield Network team to ensure safety and avoid scams.Telegram | Discord | Medium",
