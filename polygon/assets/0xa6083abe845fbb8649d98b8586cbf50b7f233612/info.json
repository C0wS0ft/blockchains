 "Description": "The Paycer team is building a cross-chain yield aggregation bridge protocol for DeFi and banking for mainstream adoption. The Paycer Protocol will provide cross-chain operability and aggregate certain DeFi products from different blockchains. The Paycer Platform will combine the Paycer Protocol with traditional financial services like a bank account and a debit card. Users only need to make a fiat money deposit on the Paycer platform to get started, no interaction with cryptocurrencies or DeFi is required.Telegram | MediumWhitepaper",
